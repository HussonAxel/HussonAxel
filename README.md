###  ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Axel. I am currently doing an apprenticeship at Smile since September 2022.
I am currently exploring positions to continue my apprenticeship training at OpenClassrooms for a Bachelor's degree level program as a JavaScript/React developer.

Currently, I am engaged in an multiples projects that aims to enhance the user experience of League Of Legends & Pokemon fans by leveraging my diverse skillset. Rather than simply developing multiple projects, I am focusing on a significant project that involves improving an existing application.

This ongoing project is a chance for me to hone my skills and explore new avenues such as questionnaire development, statistical research, comparative analysis with competing alternatives, and implementing a systematic work methodology. These experiences will help me interact with future collaborators more effectively while pushing my boundaries and developing new competencies.

With my expertise in Layout, Prototype, User Flow, Site Map, API usage, React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a professional challenge that allows me to leverage my existing skills while exploring new ones. By managing the Design, Development, and Deployment processes, I aim to take this project to its successful completion, which in turn will help me to further my career goals.
