###  ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Axel. I'm 20 and i'm following a work-linked training with OpenClassrooms. I'm still looking for someone to hire, so dont be afraid to reach me!

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on : <br>
Rather than developing many projects, I have at heart to carry out a big project in order to improve something that already exists. Based on the Spotify application, I wanted to use all the skills I have in order to improve the user experience. <br>

This project, still in progress, will allow me to develop new skills (questionnaires, statistical research, comparisons with competing alternatives), to acquire a certain working methodology, so as to be clear and organized in order to be able to exchange with future collaborators, but also to improve the skills that I have already been able to acquire in the past (Layout, Prototype, User Flow, Site Map, use of API, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.) <br>

   Clearly, this project concerning the Spotify application is a way for me to use all the skills that I have been able to acquire during my years of development while having a relatively "professional" project, while discovering new things, by managing the Design, development and deployment part. <br>
      
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning how to : <br>
            - Prototyping on Figma <br>
            - Making apps with react and API  <br>
            - Backend to become fullstack <br> <br>
